description: "Pull Requests (PRs) are the primary way to contribute code changes to D2D Cure. This guide will walk you through the process of creating, submitting, and managing pull requests."

## Main Development Branch

- The `dev` branch is our main development branch (not `main` ). This is because the production environment, Vercel, is configured to track changes on the `dev` branch and auto-deploy when any changes are detected 
- Thus the `dev` branch serves as the source of truth for the latest stable code

## Keeping Your Local Codebase Synced to GitHub Repo

1. Check to see if your local codebase is synced to the GitHub repo: 

   ```bash Terminal
   > git remote -v 
   ```

   If it is not, then sync it by running: 

   ```bash Terminal
   > git remote add origin https://github.com/d2dcure/d2d-cure.git
   ```
2. Ensure your local `dev` branch is up to date:

   ```bash Terminal
   > git checkout dev
   > git pull origin dev
   ```

## Creating a New Branch 

Any changes you make to the codebase (new features, bug fixes, etc) must be done in a new branch that will later be submitted as a PR and later (if everything looks good) merged into the `dev` branch. Never work in the  `dev` branch directly, as this branch syncs directly with the production environment.

### Branch Naming Convention

- Use kebab-case format
- Add a descriptive title based on what changes you're making
- Example: `add-user-authentication`

### Steps to Create a Branch & Submit a PR 

1. Make sure `dev` is up to date, then create a new branch off of it: 

   ```bash Terminal
   > git checkout dev
   > git pull origin dev
   > git checkout -b branch-name-here
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if needed):

   ```bash Terminal
   > npm install
   ```
3. Make your code changes 
4. When you're done, now it's time to commit your changes and create the PR: 

   ```bash Terminal
   > git add .
   > git commit -m "your description of changes here" 
   > git push origin branch-name-here
   ```
5. Go to the GitHub repository, click "Compare & pull request", and then scroll down and click "Create Pull Request". Make sure you are merging your branch into the `dev` branch. Someone will review it and merge it for you if everything looks good

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Merge Conflicts

1. Update your branch with latest `dev`:

   ```bash Terminal
   > git checkout dev
   > git pull origin dev
   > git checkout branch-name-here
   > git merge dev
   ```
2. Resolve conflicts in your code editor
3. Commit the resolved conflicts
4. Push the changes

### Failed CI Checks

- Review the error messages by running: 

  ```bash Terminal
  > npm build
  ```
- Fix any failing tests
- Address linting issues
- Push the fixes
