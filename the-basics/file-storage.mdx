## AWS S3

### What is S3? 

Amazon S3, or Amazon Simple Storage Service, is **a cloud-based object storage service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. It provides a way to store and retrieve any amount of data, from anywhere, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. S3 is designed for durability, scalability, and security, with features like automatic encryption and access management tools.Â Objects are organized into buckets, which are containers for your data. 

### What are buckets? 

An Amazon S3 bucket is **a fundamental component of Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3), acting as a container for storing and managing data in the cloud**. Essentially, it's a public cloud storage resource where data is stored as "objects" instead of traditional files. These buckets are highly scalable, durable, and secure, making them suitable for various storage needs, including backups, website hosting, and data archiving. For this codebase, the name of the bucket where everything is stored is `d2dcurebucketprod` . This is further split into folders like `gel_images` , `kinetic_assay` , and so on. For access the the AWS S3 dashboard, please contact support. 

### Interacting with S3

The configuration file `s3config.js` in the root directory is what establishes the connection between the codebase and the D2DCure S3 bucket in the cloud. As long as you have the proper environment variables configured the connection should establish automatically. Now when you want to actually interact with S3 (uploading, getting, or deleting files from the bucket), you would use the `s3.ts` API endpoint file:
