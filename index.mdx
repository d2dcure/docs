## What is D2DCure?

The Design2Data Program involves students in an investigation of the sequence-structure-function relationship of proteins. Using the lens of protein biochemistry, students expand their knowledge and develop skills by engaging in a research workflow representative of cutting-edge biotechnology training in high demand by employers.

<Note>
  **Note**: this documentation is primarily intended to provide an in-depth explanation of the underlying codebase that powers the website—its structure, components, and internal logic—rather than serving as a guide for end users on how to navigate or use the website’s features, OR as a tutorial for how to use React. A basic understanding of React & Next.js is recommended, which you can learn about [here](https://nextjs.org/learn).
